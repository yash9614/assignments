    "'''Sure, here are the mathematical steps to determine the time complexity of the provided quicksort algorithm:\n",

    "1. **Partitioning:**\n",
    "   - The partitioning process iterates through the array once, which takes \\( O(n) \\) time, where \\( n \\) is the number of elements in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recursion:**\n",
    "   - After partitioning, the quicksort algorithm makes recursive calls on the left and right subarrays.\n",
    "   - In each recursive call, the array size reduces. In the best case, the array is halved in each recursive call.\n",
    "   - The depth of recursion in the best case is \\( O(\\log n) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Combining Subarrays:**\n",
    "   - After the recursive calls, the algorithm combines the sorted subarrays, which takes \\( O(n) \\) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the overall time complexity \\( T(n) \\) can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ T(n) = \\underbrace{O(n)}_{\\text{Partitioning}} + 2 \\cdot T\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right) + \\underbrace{O(n)}_{\\text{Combining}} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving this recurrence relation, we find that the time complexity of the quicksort algorithm is \\( O(n \\log n) \\) on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the mathematical steps involved in determining the time complexity involve analyzing the time required for partitioning, recursion, and combining subarrays, and then expressing the overall time complexity using a recurrence relation. Finally, solving the recurrence relation yields the time complexity of the algorithm.\n",
